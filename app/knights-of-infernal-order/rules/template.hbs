<div class="list-div">
  <p class="left oswald margin-bottom-1"><strong>RULES:</strong></p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">1:Don’t be an A-hole! Breaking and entering, vandalism, or destruction of private property of any kind is strictly forbidden.</p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">2:Please be vigilant of your surroundings AT ALL TIMES. We don’t want anyone getting hurt. That’s bad news bears for all of us!</p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">3:Any location you will be asked to visit IS publically accessible. In the event that a puzzle is hidden inside of a business that is closed, you MUST wait until the business is open to access it.</p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">4:If your adventure is timed, it will begin once you have reached the first chapter. If you prefer not to be timed, feel free to disable the clock.
</p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">5:If you are having trouble, don’t be afraid to use the hints. We might make fun of you for having to, but we won’t deduct time.
</p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">6:Seriously, don’t be an A-hole!
</p>
  <p class="left margin-bottom-1">7:Please don’t ruin the adventure for others. If you find an artifact connected to the game, you are welcome to take a picture of it for later use. Then please, put it back WHERE and HOW you found it. How would you feel if you payed good money to play and couldn’t continue thanks to some joker?
</p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">8:In the event that an artifact is missing, contact us immediately and you will be promptly emailed a digital version of the artifact or puzzle.
</p>
  <p class="left libre-baskerville margin-bottom-1">9:Please help us keep the wonder and discovery alive for others. We ask that you not give the story away to those who haven’t played. It would be like telling someone that Han Solo dies at the end of The Force Awakens.
