  It seems your instincts have served you
                well! After further scanning of our
                database, we’ve discovered some
                fascinating information that might be of use
                to you in your journey.

  Phoenix Lodge No. 131, held its first
                meeting on December 27, 1851. The Lodge met
                in the Cumberland Lodge building until a fire
                destroyed the building in July of 1856. In
                1858, a cornerstone was laid by Cumberland
                Lodge for a new temple, and it was completed
                in time to be occupied by the Federal forces
                during the Civil War.

  From December 1861 to December 1863,
                Phoenix Lodge met in various places while the
                Cumberland building was occupied. This is the
                only exception to the continuous meeting of
                Phoenix Lodge throughout its 150+ years of
                existence. Following the Civil War, and up to
                the present day, Phoenix has continued to meet
                in the Cumberland Lodge building, which is known as
                the "Second Temple".

<p class="left">Our researchers have also discovered that Mr.
                Eastman was on record as being initiated into
                Freemasonry at the Phoenix Lodge #131. This most
                certainly must be one of the posts the knights seized
                and used for their bidding.</p>
<p class="left">Lastly, our cryptologists have obtained fresh
                information from Mr. Woodson’s diary, please activate
                the Decodex below.</p>
