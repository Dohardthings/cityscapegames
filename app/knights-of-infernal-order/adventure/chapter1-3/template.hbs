      Unfortunately, little else can be extracted from the journal at this time as a peculiar cipher has been used to protect the secrets contained in its pages. While our cryptologists work to break the code, please investigate the location of this meeting place as quickly as possible. With a nefarious agent amongst us, we must assume that the Infernal Order is receiving the same information.
