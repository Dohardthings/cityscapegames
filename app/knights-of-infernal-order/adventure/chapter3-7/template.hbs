      We are quite confident that Captain Green was using the missing memorial to guide Mr. Woodson to the final temple. Unfortunately, we are unable to confirm this belief with evidence as the part of the journal that held Green and Eastman’s new key has deteriorated into such poor condition that it cannot be read. Nevertheless, we will not be deterred!

    <p class="left">If we are to assume that this is the Temple of the Flame Upon the Cross, then logic would dictate that the mysterious new resident seen conversing with Reverend Green and his son must be one of our agents or their lieutenant.

Our research has just revealed something very interesting. You should locate the former building known as Earthman’s Saloon.
