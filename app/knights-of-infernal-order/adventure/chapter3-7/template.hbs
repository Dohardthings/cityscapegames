    <p class="left">Friend,</p>

    <p class="left">
      We are quite confident that the missing
                memorial to A.L.P. Green is how the Captain
                was guiding Mr. Woodson to the final temple.
                Unfortunately, we are unable to corroborate
                this evidence. The part of the blasted diary
                that held Green and Eastmanâ€™s new key has
                deteriorated to such a condition that it
                cannot be read! However, we must not give
                up!
    </p>
    <p class="left">If we are to assume that this is the
                Temple of the Flame Upon the Cross, then logic
                would dictate that  the mysterious new resident
                seen confiding with Reverend Green and his son
                must be one of our agents or their lieutenant.
                Your GPS locator shows that you are less than a
                mile south of the town.</p>
    <p class="left">Please my friend, search the tiny hamlet
                for any sign of the captured Mr. Hill or the
                escaped Mr. Woodson and Howard. Any marker that
                might guide us in our journey! When you believe
                you have uncovered our next location please
                enter it below.</p>


    <p class="left">
      Sincerely,
    </p>
