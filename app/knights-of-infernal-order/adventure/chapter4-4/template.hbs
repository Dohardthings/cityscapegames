    <p class="left">
      Wonderful work! According to noted
                western historians the home at Fatherland
                street housed Jesse James from shortly after the
                Northfield Bank robbery until March 25, 1881,
                the day after Bill Ryan was captured at
                Earthman's Saloon in the White's Creek area. He
                then fled to Saint Joseph.  During this period
                Jesse used the name J.D. Howard. Which means our
                Mr. Woodson must have been his brother Frank
                James. We must visit the James house. Who knows
                what we may uncover. When you arrive please
                enter the color of the next residence to the
                left below.
