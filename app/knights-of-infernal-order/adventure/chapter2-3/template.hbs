      What an interesting turn of events.
                      According to Eastman's diary, not only were
                      the Knights discovered due to a drunken rant
                      by Mr. Hill, but it looks as if Mr. Woodsonâ€™s
                      name was James. Oh how the plot deepens by
                      the moment! But we must not get ahead of
                      ourselves. For now we must concentrate on the
                      solution to the anagram,  it must reveal the
                      location of the temple Charles Eastman wrote
                      about. Do your best to research the solution
                      further. When you feel you have discovered
                      its location, please enter the address below.
