    <p class="left">Friend,</p>

    <p class="left">
What an interesting turn of events! According to Mr. Eastman’s diary, not only were the Knights discovered due to a drunken rant by Mr. Hill, but it looks as if Mr. Woodson’s true name was James. The plot thickens by the very moment!     </p>

<p class="left">We must concentrate on the solution to the anagram as we believe it reveals the location of the Temple mentioned in Mr. Eastman’s memoir.
</p>
<p class="left">
  Research the solution further, and when you feel you have discovered its location, please enter the address below.

      Sincerely,
    </p>
