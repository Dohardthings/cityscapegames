    <p class="left">
We haven't much time! We just intercepted a transmission that the Infernal Order sent to their mole inside our organization. Included in that message was the image below. If you tap the photograph for a closer examination, you will see what looks to be a cornerstone like the one mentioned in the Jesse James key.     </p>

                  <p class="left">Our researchers have combed through the archives and referenced the same location using a historical photograph taken from a bell tower. By superimposing the two photographs, they are able to give us a clue as to what stood there before the great Edgefield fire. Take note of the cornerstone’s location at the bottom left of the image.</p>
