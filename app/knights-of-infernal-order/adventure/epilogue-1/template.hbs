  <p class="left">Friend,</p>

<p class="left">
  Many Knights of the Sun have knelt
                  at the cornerstone of the Second Temple
                  to recite the oath of our Order. Through
                  the demonstration of your bravery, skill,
                  and honor you have been deemed fit to do
                  the same.
</p>

<p class="left">
  By taking this oath you adopt our
                  banner and its symbol, Fritillaria
                  Imperialis, the Emperor's Crown Tulip.
                  It is an allegory for the Sun, the light
                  that staves off the darkness. You are
                  now a bearer of this light and pledge
                  your soul to protecting it as a lion,
                  from those who would attempt to stamp it
                  out. You are charged with continuing
                  the good work of this second order of
                  knights that have resurrected themselves
                  out of the ruins of the first.
                </p>
<p class="left">
  You now hold the honor of being
                initiated into a long line of honorable
                men and women that include Frank and
                Jesse James, as well as members of your
                own family. Welcome my friend, to the
                Order of the Sun! Now kneel at the
                cornerstone and recite this oath:

</p>

<p class="oath">
  My soul is with the knights who guard
                  the Tulip.
</p>
<p class="oath">
  At the edge of a field  I lurk
                  among those who have breathed forth
                  fire and scathed the earth.
</p>
<p class="oath">
  But the sons of men, whose fangs
                  are spears and arrows and their tongue
                  a sharp sword will once again rise.
</p>
<p class="oath">
  As does the Phoenix, as does the
                  Flame Upon the Cross, and as does the
                  Sun.
</p>
<p class="oath">
  Laying the cornerstone for the Second
                  Temple that shall be resurrected out of the
                  ruins of the first.
</p>

<p class="left">Congratulations my friend. You have
                completed a great journey. We shall
                call upon you from time to time
                whenever your services are needed.
                Although there was no true threat this
                time, the threat of the Infernal Order
                remains and is very real. Together we
                shall answer the call to protect the
                world from their treachery.</p>
