  <p class="p2">A stroll through the streets of historic Edgefield,
                Tennessee’s first historic district, is like taking a step
                back in time.
  </p>
  <p class="p2">Located on the East bank of the Cumberland River, just
                blocks from downtown Nashville, its prime location offers
                urban living at its best. This is true today, as it was when
                Edgefield was an independent city from Jan 2, 1869 until it
                was annexed by Nashville on February 6, 1880 and rechristened
                East Nashville. The founders of Nashville's premier
                businesses, doctors, governors, educators, and even Jesse and
                Frank James called Edgefield home. It is purported, and some
                claim documented, that Jesse attended and taught Sunday School
                at a church in Edgefield. Jesse's home still stands today, as
                does many of the original homes. This is extremely remarkable
                when considering the tragedies and obstacles which these
                residents have overcome throughout the decades.
  </p>


  <p class="p2">On a Wednesday in March, the great Edgefield fire, East
                Nashville’s first major disaster, struck. Around 11:47 a.m.,
                a fire started in a mill located on the banks of the Cumberland.
                Heavy March winds, with gales from 44-51 mph, fanned the flames
                through the streets of Edgefield consuming most buildings in
                its path. This great conflagration was finally brought under
                control but only after destroying 648 homes and businesses, and
                leaving over 3,000 homeless. Many of the affluent residents took
                flight across the river to Bellvue, but many other stalwart
                individuals remained in Edgefield to rebuild it from the ashes.
  </p>
  <p class="p2">Today the streets are buzzing with activity. Residents once
                called Edgefield Nashville's best kept secret but it seems the
                secret is out.
