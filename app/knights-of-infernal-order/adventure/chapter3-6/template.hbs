  <p class="p2">This history of the Whites Creek area by Mrs. Arnow, which includes
              testimonies from the community's leaders, reports the following:
  </p>
  <p class="p2">"In the fall of 1872, the good Reverend Green had worked himself into a lather about the building of a new church. Though it was oft said that gossip was the work of the Devil himself, many of the town folk whispered that the Reverend's latest passion was intimately connected to the area’s newest resident. Not much was known to us about this mysterious gentleman, but he had been seen speaking in confidence with the Reverend and his son, Frank Waters Green, on multiple occasions."

  </p>


  <p class="p2">Seven years after Reverend Green’s death, his son—by this point, a Captain in the 14th TN Infantry—requested that the congregation add a memorial in the front of the church in his father’s honor. As it was later recorded:

  </p>
  <p class="p2">“Though fellow members of the church found the proposed memorial to be unusual, we felt it would do dishonor to the gallant war hero and 'The Lion of Appomattox' to deny his request. His father was, after all, the cornerstone of the church."

  </p>
  <p class="p2">Captain Green sought to have a sundial placed on the front lawn, facing due east, just as the church did. On the face of the dial, Captain Green had these words engraved:

  </p>
  <p class="p2">"And behold, at the entrance to the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men with their backs to the temple of the Lord and their faces toward the east; and they were prostrating themselves eastward toward the Sun.
  </p>

  <p class="p2">Ezekiel 8:16".
  </p>

  <p class="p2">Regretfully, the Freemasons removed the memorial when they later took control of the property. In its place, they erected a stone memorial to James Bent.
