                  I have received word from our loyal sentinels in Nashville. Green and Eastman have called upon my brother’s neighbors in Edgefield under the guise of business with “Mr. Howard.” The neighborhood’s residents revealed that the recently missing Sunday school teacher had once lived at 711 Fatherland Street. Using the map key that he contributed upon our arrival to Davidson County, our acolytes have located his Temple and found the trove still in tact! After much discussion about the attention brought on by Mr. Hill’s incarceration, they have decided to leave the three united troves at rest under the Temple of the Sun. With the treasure safe, my heart may finally rest easy.
