We here at Cityscape really appreciate you going on this journey with us, and taking the time to help us make this
adventure the best we can make it!  We want people to go on adventures right in the city where they live,
and experience their world in a new way. And hopefully, get a little of thier sense of wonder back.  Now, you are part
 of making that dream a reality.  It would mean everything to us if you would let us buy you a drink or a coffee
soon so you can tell us about your experience.  <strong class="yellow">And to sweeten the deal, we'll refund half of your purchase price at
the interview!</strong>
